## Discriminative defeasible inference task
Paper description: finetuned RoBERTa-base, trained 2 epochs, concatenated P,H,U (separated by special token)

Paper Reported RoBERTa classifier results (Best of 5 runs)

| Task   | Inputs    | Dev Set Acc | Test Set Acc |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| δ-SNLI    | (P,H,U)  | 83.3 | 81.6 |
| δ-ATOMIC    |  (P,H,U) |  78.6  | 78.3  |
| δ-Social    | (P,H,U)  |  85.7 | 86.2  |

I used the following format as model input
```
input=tokenizer(f"[premise] {premise} [hypo] {hypothesis} [update] {update}")
```

Huggingface **RobertaForSequenceClassification** with RoBERTa-base pretrained weights was used as the classifier and trained with Huggingface Trainer.

Train parameters are as follwing
```
max_seq_length = 128
batch_size = 16
learning_rate = 1e-5
```

# Overview

The Defeasible-NLI dataset consists of three portions, extending the ATOMIC (Sap et al. 2019), SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), and Social-Chemistry-101 (Forbes et al., 2020) datasets. These portions are called defeasible-atomic, defeasible-snli, and defeasible-social, respectively. (Or "delta-atomic," "delta-snli," and "delta-social" for short.)

```
└── data
    └── defeasible-nli
        ├── defeasible-atomic
        │   ├── dev.jsonl

        ├── defeasible-snli

            ├── dev.jsonl
            ├── test.jsonl
            └── train.jsonl
```

The train/dev/test splits are consistent with the original splits in each of these datasets.

# Data Format

Each line represents a JSON object with a single Premise-Hypothesis-Update tuple (or, in the case of delta-social, just Hypothesis-Update tuples), and additional fields for meta-data. Some fields are shared across all three sections, and others are dataset-specific.

## Shared Fields

**DataSource** :: The originating dataset.

**AssignmentIdAnon** :: Mechanical Turk assignment ID mapped to integers unique within the dataset.

**WorkerIdAnon** :: An anonymized integer ID for each Mechanical Turk annotator.

**Premise** :: The premise (P) sentence. Only present for ATOMIC and SNLI portions. For delta-atomic the premise is the antecedent event description. For delta-snli, the premise is straightforwardly the SNLI premise.

**Hypothesis** :: The hypothesis (H) sentence. Present for all three portions. For delta-atomic, it is the right-hand side inference. For delta-snli it is straightforwardly the SNLI hypothesis. For delta-social, it is the "rule of thumb" (and matches the "SocialChemROT" field identically.)

**Update** :: The update sentence (U) written by the annotator, which is either a strengthener or a weakener. (Novel to defeasible-NLI.)

**UpdateType** :: Indicates whether the update (U) is a strengthener or weakener. Values are "strengthener" or "weakener".

**UpdateTypeImpossible** :: Boolean indicating whether the annotator checked the "impossible" box. If true, the annotator found it impossible to write an update (of type UpdateType) for the given premise-hypothesis pair. If value is true, then Update field is empty.

**UpdateTypeImpossibleReason** :: If UpdateTypeImpossible field set to true, this is the annotator's free-form response to why the update was impossible to write.

## Dataset-Specific Fields

### delta-atomic

* **AtomicEventId**
* **AtomicEventRelationId**
* **AtomicRelationType**
* **AtomicInference**

### delta-snli

* **SNLIPairId**

### delta-social

* **SocialChemSituationUID**
* **SocialChemSituation**
* **SocialChemROT** (Note: same as Hypothesis field.)

# Important Note

For completeness, we have included instances where annotators indicated that writing an update strengthener or update weakener was impossible. These are indicated when the "UpdateTypeImpossible" field is set to "true". These instances are omitted from the experiments of Rudinger et al. 2020.

Compared to existing resources that center around taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed &lt;em&gt;if-then&lt;/em&gt; relations with variables (e.g., â&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; X pays Y a compliment, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; Y will likely return the complimentâ). We propose nine &lt;em&gt;if-then&lt;/em&gt; relation types to distinguish causes vs. effects, agents vs. themes, voluntary vs. involuntary events, and actions vs. mental states. By generatively training on the rich inferential knowledge described in ATOMIC, we show that neural models can acquire simple commonsense capabilities and reason about previously unseen events. Experimental results demonstrate that multitask models that incorporate the hierarchical structure of &lt;em&gt;if-then&lt;/em&gt; relation types lead to more accurate inference compared to models trained in isolation, as measured by both automatic and human evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={01}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Sap, Maarten and Le Bras, Ronan and Allaway, Emily and Bhagavatula, Chandra and Lourie, Nicholas and Rashkin, Hannah and Roof, Brendan and Smith, Noah A. and Choi, Yejin}, year={2019}, month={Jul.}, pages={3027-3035} }
